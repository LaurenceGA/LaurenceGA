### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer with a customer-centric and business-aware approach to product development, good communication skills, and practical experience with a large array of technologies.

I am interested in high performance, flexible software as well as clean code and test driven development.

I pick things up quickly, enjoy problem solving and love learning.
